# CQELS+: Boosting performance of Linked Stream Processing for the CQELS engine.
CQELS+ is a Linked Stream Processing engine which is extended from the CQELS engine(http://cqels.googlecode.com/). CQELS+ is able to handle

We evaluated its performance in comparison with the CQELS engine on the Streaming RDF/SPARQL Benchmark(https://www.w3.org/wiki/SRBench) over two aspects: The throughput(the number of input data items processed in a time unit) and the memory consumption.
